# üîê Automated & Secure VPC Deployment with AWS CLI (QA Perspective)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to **automate the creation and validation of a secure, scalable AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** using AWS CLI commands. The focus is on **ensuring reliable infrastructure setup, repeatable deployment, and correct configuration**, aligning cloud skills with QA principles.

## QA-Relevant Goals:

- Verify correct creation of VPC, subnets, route tables, and internet gateways
- Ensure security groups and access controls are consistently applied
- Automate deployment steps to reduce human error and improve reproducibility
- Document outcomes for auditing, validation, and troubleshooting

## Skills Demonstrated (QA-Related):

-Automated infrastructure provisioning via AWS CLI
- Validated network connectivity and resource accessibility
- Applied repeatable, auditable workflows for cloud environment setup
- Configured security and access rules to prevent misconfigurations
- Tracked deployment steps and results for process documentation

## Tech Stack:
- AWS CLI | Amazon VPC | Subnets | Internet Gateway | Route Tables | Security Groups

## Impact / QA Takeaway:
- Highlights ability to **design repeatable and validated infrastructure processes**
- Demonstrates **process-oriented thinking**, a key QA mindset
- Prepares for QA-style tasks such as **configuration testing, regression checks, and automated verification**
